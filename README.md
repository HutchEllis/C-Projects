# C-Projects
clock.cpp was a project in which I was challenged to create a digital clock within C++.
I think one of the things I did particularly well was my display. I framed the clocks as well as the user menu in astericks.
One area I could enhance my code in is modifying the code to display the active time.
The piece of the code that was the most challenging was making sure the AM and PM corresponded with the 24 hour time.
The skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects is working with classes and objects within C++.
In order to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I split my code into a few different classes making it easier to find which lines of code do what.
